# home-labs
Hi and thanks for visting my home-lab repository. It will be a work in progress as I continue adding more examples of work in the future and other random things of interest I find related to the topic of labbing and study.

The packt_project snips are from a large project I did as class homework in Cisco Packet Tracer. There are 5 VLANs across 4 branch office regions in LA, SD, SF and NY. It is a dual stack network that routes using EIGRP, OSPF, RIP and static routing. 

My recent weekend lab consisted of learning the basics in ASA firewall configuration, using both the CLI and ASDM, as I study the CCNA security topics. I look forward to practicing it more when implementing a more permanent home lab configuration. I included the initial planning topology here as well.
